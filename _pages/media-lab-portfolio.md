> "Research is the conversion of caffeine into code, but inspiration is the conversion of experience into insight. Here are the places, sounds, and flavors that fuel my work."

## 🍜 Palettes
*I am an engineer by trade, but a cook by aspiration. While my own kitchen experiments often end in 'unexpected results' (a polite term for inedible), my fascination with the craft is boundless.

I spend my free time exploring culinary landscapes, not just to eat, but to observe. I admire how a great chef uses intuition—not just recipes—to bring life to inert ingredients. I view fine dining as a masterclass in sensory design, and I plan to one day attend culinary school to formally decode the chemistry behind the art.*

## 📍 Voyages
*My travel logic is a balance of sensory input and physical output. I build my itineraries around local food scenes, but I am equally driven by the outdoors—seeking out hiking trails, snorkeling reefs, or the occasional optimistic attempt at surfing. This combination of active discovery and culinary indulgence is how I recharge.*
