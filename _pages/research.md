My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, ubiquitous computing, and health sensing**.

## Core Research Themes

### 1. Multimodal Wearable Sensing
Fusing **IMU, PPG, acoustic, and contextual data** to model human activity, behavior, and physiology in the wild.

- Activity-based health insights on Galaxy Watch (IMU + PPG + context)
- Sensor data fusion for robust, noise-tolerant inference

### 2. Acoustic and Novel Input for Wearables
Designing **acoustic-sensing input mechanisms** and subtle interaction channels for resource-constrained devices.

- Low-intensity acoustic input for headless wearables (MFCC + spectrogram)
- Homonym disambiguation based on tone and prosody for hands-free control

### 3. AI for Mobile Health & Personal Informatics
Using **time-series modeling** and **context-aware feedback** to support health behavior change and self-reflection.

- Turning sensor streams into **interpretable health insights**
- Personalization across users, routines, and environments

### 4. On-Device & Resource-Constrained ML
Optimizing **models, pipelines, and sensors** to run directly on watches, phones, and IoT devices.

- TensorFlow Lite deployment
- Model compression and pipeline optimization for real-time operation

### 5. Learning & Optimization
Reinforcement learning and curriculum learning for **structured problems** and adaptive systems.

- RL-based TSP with hardness-adaptive curriculum
- Ideas toward **adaptive intervention policies** for health systems
