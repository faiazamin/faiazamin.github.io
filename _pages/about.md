I’m Faiaz, an **R&D Engineer & Inventor at Samsung Research Bangladesh (Wearable Solutions Lab)**, where I design and implement **AI-driven sensing features** for Galaxy Watches and mobile devices.

### What I do

- Build **multimodal sensing systems** with IMU, PPG, audio, and contextual data
- Design **on-device ML pipelines** under tight power and memory constraints
- Prototype **novel interaction modalities** for wearables and mobile health
- Develop features for **Galaxy Wearable** App 
- Collaborate with designers and researchers to bring POCs into product pathways

### Education

- 🎓 **B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering**, University of Dhaka  
  Thesis: *“Deep Learning Approach to Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem with Hardness-Adaptive Curriculum”*

### Experience

- **Senior Engineer (Android & ML Application) @ Samsung R&D Institute** (_Jun 2023–Present_)  
  - Research: context-aware health info recommendations for Galaxy Watch; AI-based perspective distortion removal for cameras, tone/context-based keyword recognition for Samsung phones; focus-level sensing with earbuds, phone, CV, UWB, and EEG; .  
  - Development: built mechanistic recommendation process for Galaxy Wearable App; maintained local rendering for Galaxy Watches; raised test coverage (50% → 84%); fixed PLM and static-analysis issues.
- **Prompt Engineer @ Scale AI (Outlier)** (_Mar 2024–Nov 2024_)  
  - Refined LLM prompts, conversational flows, and conditions; set guardrails and monitored performance quality.
- **Research Aide @ Cognitive Agents & Interaction Lab** (_Mar 2022–Feb 2023_)  
  - Collected, processed, and analyzed data for deep-learning studies on combinatorial optimization.

Outside of work, I’m into **math contests**, **travelling**, **hiking**, **swimming** and lately I’m trying to become a **decent cook** and explore new cuisines.
