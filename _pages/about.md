I’m Faiaz, a **Software Engineer at Samsung Research (Wearable Solutions Lab)**, where I design and implement **AI-driven sensing features** for Galaxy Watches and mobile devices.

### What I do

- Build **multimodal sensing systems** with IMU, PPG, audio, and contextual data
- Design **on-device ML pipelines** under tight power and memory constraints
- Prototype **novel interaction modalities** for wearables and mobile health
- Collaborate with designers and researchers to bring POCs into product pathways

### Recent highlights

- 🏅 **Samsung A2 patent grade** for an **acoustic-signal–based input mechanism** for headless wearables (pending KIPO filing)
- 🏅 Activity-based **health insight recommendation system** showcased at **Samsung AI POC Exhibition (SRBD)**
- 📊 Contributions to **CV-based perspective distortion correction** for mobile photography, awarded **A1 patent grade**
- 🎓 B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering, University of Dhaka  
  Thesis: *“Deep Learning Approach to Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem with Hardness-Adaptive Curriculum”*

Outside of work, I’m into **math contests**, **competitive programming**, and lately I’m trying to become a **decent cook** and explore new cuisines.
