## Overview

Undergraduate thesis project exploring a **Reinforcement Learning approach** to the **Travelling Salesman Problem** with a **hardness-adaptive curriculum** to stabilize training.

## Approach

- Designed a curriculum that **adjusts graph hardness** based on agent performance.
- Implemented RL baselines and **evaluation pipeline** to compare sample efficiency and solution quality.
- Integrated **1.5-approximation heuristics** into the reward to guide exploration.

## Results

- Improved training stability over greedy roll-out baselines.
- Demonstrated higher-quality tours on medium-sized TSP instances.
