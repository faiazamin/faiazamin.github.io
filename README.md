# Faiaz Amin Khan

I am a Computer Science graduate currently working at Samsung R&D Institute. My interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, multimodal learning models, and reinforcement learning. I have completed my undergraduate thesis focused on reinforcement learning and continue to explore these fields through my professional and personal projects.
