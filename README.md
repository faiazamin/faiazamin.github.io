- Set up conversational conditions and responses
- Monitored LLM performance.

**Research Aide @ Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (_March 2022 - February 2023_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of deep learning models on combinatorial optimization problem.

## Undergraduate Thesis
**Deep Learning Approach to Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem with Hardness-Adaptive Curriculum**
- Uncovered novel deep learning-based solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), improving solution efficiency.
- Integrated TSP 1.5-approximation algorithm into the complexity function, enhancing model accuracy.
- Developed an enhanced benchmark model using the REINFORCE algorithm, outperforming the greedy roll-out method.

## Projects
### Classbot
#### Tools: Python, scikit learn, nltk, numpy
[Link](https://github.com/faiazamin/ClassBot)

Developed a command-line chatbot, using **python**, designed to assist students by providing quick and accurate responses to common queries. It handles questions related to class schedules, faculty details, and general inquiries, making it a helpful tool for managing academic information. The chatbot simplifies access to important details, allowing students to retrieve information without needing to navigate complex systems. Its user-friendly command-line interface ensures that students can interact with it efficiently.

### Microcontroller Based Human Face Detector
#### Tools: Arduino, C, C++
Developed a microcontroller-based human detection system. An arduino based circuit system that included a camera and a microcontroller. I completed the circuit, implemented the logics and used computer vision algorithm to detect humans in the camera preview window.

### Finding Important Factors for Movies Ratings
[Link](https://github.com/faiazamin/important_factors_for_movieratings)
#### Tools: R
Developed a linear regression model that fits for the IMDB ratings for a movie. Here the dataset is a collection of information and rating both imdb and rotten tomatoes for 651 movies those were released before 2016.  Here my response variable will be IMDB ratings. I want know about the characteristics that make a movies more likely to get a better rating on IMDB. I perfromed the exploratory data analysis, checked the linearity and co-linearity between features, trained a linear regression model, and finally discussed end results.

### Donate+
[Link](https://github.com/faiazamin/Donate_plus)
#### Tools: Java, Android Studio, Google Firebase, Google Maps
Developed a android application that aims to connect blood donors to the patients those need blood for medical purpose. Users can create account with their contact and blood group informtaion and post request for blood. Our system will notify all the users having the same blood group within the locality. Interested blood donor can contact the patient and confirm the request. App will present the google map location of the patient so that donors find it easy to reach the designated institute.

### Dictionary.co
#### Tools: Java, Android Studio
[Link](https://github.com/faiazamin/Dictionaryco)

Developed an Android-based English-to-Bangla dictionary app that efficiently translates English keywords into their corresponding Bengali words. The app uses the perfect hashing technique to map English words to their Bangla translations, ensuring fast and accurate retrieval. By leveraging this method, the dictionary optimizes performance, providing users with quick and reliable results without collisions or unnecessary delays.
