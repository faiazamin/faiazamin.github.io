**Bridging Novel Sensing & Contextual Intelligence**

---
I’m a Research Software Engineer & Inventor at **Samsung Research (Wearable Solutions Lab)**, where I design and build **AI-driven sensing and interaction systems** for **Galaxy Watches** and the **Galaxy Wearable App**

I work at the intersection of:

- 🛰️ **Mobile & ubiquitous computing**
- ⌚ **Multimodal wearable sensing** (IMU, PPG, audio, context)
- 🧠 **AI for health & personal informatics**
- 🎛️ **On-device & resource-constrained ML**

My long-term goal is to build **intelligent, context-aware systems** that turn everyday devices into *trustworthy companions* for health, behavior, and interaction.
