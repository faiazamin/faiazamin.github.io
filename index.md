# Hi, I’m Faiaz 👋

I’m a Software Engineer at **Samsung Research (Wearable Solutions Lab)**, where I design and build **AI-driven sensing systems** for **Galaxy Watches** and the **Galaxy Wearable App**.

I work at the intersection of:

- 🛰️ **Mobile & ubiquitous computing**
- ⌚ **Multimodal wearable sensing** (IMU, PPG, audio, context)
- 🧠 **AI for health & personal informatics**
- 🎛️ **On-device & resource-constrained ML**

My long-term goal is to build **intelligent, context-aware systems** that turn everyday devices into *trustworthy companions* for health, behavior, and interaction.
